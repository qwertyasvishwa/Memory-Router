# UI Smoke Checklist (Premium + Pixel Discipline)

Use this checklist when adding/updating Tools pages or collateral templates.

## Layout & spacing

- Header/nav wraps cleanly at ~960px without uneven gaps.
- All cards align to the same grid; no “off by 1px” padding differences between sections.
- Consistent vertical rhythm (spacing steps: 8/12/16/24px).

## Typography

- Headings use consistent weights; avoid mixing too many font weights.
- Body copy uses muted color; high contrast only for key labels/titles.

## Color & contrast

- Accent usage is restrained (dividers, badges, key CTAs only).
- No large saturated blocks unless explicitly part of the brand.

## Components

- Buttons have consistent height, padding, and radius.
- Form controls align; labels are above inputs; no misaligned baselines.

## Print/readiness (collaterals)

- Business card pages render at 3.5×2 in and respect safe margins.
- Letterhead renders at A4 with correct header/footer spacing.
- Email signature renders correctly in Outlook/Gmail-style HTML (table layout).

## Brand safety

- Missing logo doesn’t break layout (logo area collapses gracefully).
- Missing website/contact fields don’t create awkward empty blocks.
