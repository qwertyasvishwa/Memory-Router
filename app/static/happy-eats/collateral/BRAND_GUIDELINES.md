## 📜 Brand Story

Born from the warmth of Indian kitchens, Happy Eats brings you authentic flavors rooted in tradition. Every product is handcrafted with care, using only the finest organic ingredients.

We believe in preserving the rich culinary heritage of India while meeting modern wellness standards. From Gujarat's golden khakhras to Kerala's crispy banana chips—each bite tells a story of home, health, and heritage.

Our journey began in a small village kitchen where grandmothers' recipes met modern food science. Today, we scale that same love and attention to detail, ensuring every package carries the soul of traditional Indian cooking.
